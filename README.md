HOW TO USE
==================================================

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
In order to run this project you need to have Docker > 1.17.05 installed for building the production image.

### Repository structure
Repository holds two top-level directories, `pkg` and `cmd`.

`pkg` directory contains directories for each of libraries.

`cmd` directory contains directories for each of binaries.

### Configuration
Create your local `.env` file from `dist.env` files.

For each of binaries when building a docker image the enviroment variable file will be passed. This repository contains example `.env` file for `server` binary. There are always two files `.server.env` containing local configurations and is to be git ignored where [dist.server.env](dist.server.env) contains versioned example of configuration.

### Development
To setup development enviroment simply run [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) command. The containers will be set up for each binaries and other services required for application to run.

### Deployment
**Release all binaries**
```sh
$> make all-release
```
**Release single binary**
```sh
$> make release-server
```
Other available commands: `build`, `run`, `stop`, `rm`, `release`, `publish`, `publish-latest`, `publish-version`, `tag`, `tag-latest`, `tag-version`. All comands follow the same convention for all binaries add `all-` prefix, for one binary add `-%` sufix where `%` is a directory name underneath `cmd`. For more informations about commands check [Makefile](Makefile).
